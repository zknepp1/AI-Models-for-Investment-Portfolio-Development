# Project Title
AI Models for Investment Portfolio Development

# Description

This study set out to explore the role of news-driven neural networks, particularly in Recurrent Neural Networks, and building investment portfolios with the trained models. While incorporating news-related variables into Recurrent Neural Networks, the additional news variables on predictive accuracy within the models have shown to have a marginal effect. This study contributes to the field of AI and Financial Analysis as a reminder of the importance of data quality in the nature of stock price prediction. While neural networks prove to be a powerful tool for financial analysis and decision making, quantity and quality of data are crucial for building effective models.

The code in this project is divided up between the folders "no_news" and "with_news" to keep the predictions of both models separate. From the results of the study, the models that don't contain news variables are implemented in this github project.
