# Project Title
AI Models for Investment Portfolio Development

# Description

This study set out to explore the role of news-driven neural networks, particularly in Recurrent Neural Networks, and building investment portfolios with the trained models. While incorporating news-related variables into Recurrent Neural Networks, the additional news variables on predictive accuracy within the models have shown to have a marginal effect. This study contributes to the field of AI and Financial Analysis as a reminder of the importance of data quality in the nature of stock price prediction. While neural networks prove to be a powerful tool for financial analysis and decision making, quantity and quality of data are crucial for building effective models.

The code in this project is divided up between the folders "no_news" and "with_news" to keep the predictions of both models separate. From the results of the study, the models that don't contain news variables are implemented in this github project.


# Installation Instructions

1. Clone repo into local directory.
2. Move to directory with: "cd Knepp_OUDSA5900"
3. Activate virtual environment: "source venv/bin/activate"
4. Install the necessary packages: "pip install -r requirements.txt"
5. Run the main file in the no_news folder: "python3 no_news/main.py"


# How to Use

Once the main program is executed, the program will ask the user for a list of stocks to put in the algorithmic trader.
Please keep in mind that the model building process is very time consuming. Make sure your machine has plenty of memory.
